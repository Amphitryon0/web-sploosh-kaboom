## What is Sploosh Kaboom?

Sploosh Kaboom is a minigame in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker similar to the classic board game Battleship.
In it, the player is presented with an empty board within which three squid groups of varying length are hidden.
The player can fire at a chosen grid location, which will then show whether a squid was hit there.
A group is eliminated when all of its squids are hit.
The object of the game is to eliminate all three groups within 24 shots.

### Why is Sploosh Kaboom Required for The Wind Waker 100%?

The Wind Waker 100% rules require collecting, among other things, all Pieces of Heart and Treasure Charts.
Sploosh Kaboom grants a Piece of Heart on Link's first win and a Treasure Chart on his second.
If Link wins in under 20 shots, he receives another Treasure Chart.
Because these items are required for 100%, a 100% speedrun of The Wind Waker must beat the Sploosh Kaboom minigame twice and win in under 20 shots at least once.
